Analysis of food insecurity statistics for the United States of America from 2010-2021.

For completion of the Final Project requirement of the Entity Academy, Southern Career’s Institute, and Woz-U Data Science curriculum.

A collaborative project by A. Nicole Mosley, Ivette Sierra, and Natalin Williams Sipes

# Phase 1: Dataset Collection 
### (Completed February 20, 2021)

The datasets were collected and wrangled via Microsoft Excel, RStudio, and Python from Feeding America, the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS), the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 

### Datasets from Feeding America, U.S. Census Bureau, USDA-ERS, BEA, BLS:

# Phase 2: Data Wrangling, Cleaning, and Recoding
### (Completed February 27, 2022)

Data was cleaned and recoded for analysis using RStudio and Python.

#### Data Wrangling and Cleaning: (RPP’s, State Data all years, Unemployment, and others)

# Phase 3: Exploratory Analysis
#### (Completed March 6, 2022)

Exploratory analyses included visualization and standardization of audio feature variables, as well as correlation analysis and plotting.

#### Exploratory Analysis in RStudio and Python: 
#### State projections & Heatmaps in Python by Ivette, RPP’s & Unemployement in Python/RStudio done by Nicole, Natalin done in Rstudio that week

# Phase 4: Data Analysis
#### (Completed March 13, 2022)

Dependent t-tests and histograms were used to analyze the variables and make correlations between them. The best use of our time was to create new spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. Once the spreadsheets had been created, we imported our data into RStudio and Python for analysis. We also continued to work with datasets and notebooks which analyzed regional price parities and state unemployment rates.

#### Data Analysis in RStudio and Python: (Dependent t-tests, histograms for 300 set)

# Phase 5: Data Visualization
#### (Completed March 20, 2022)

Visualizations were created in Python, Tableau, and RStudio for analyses.(Natalin created Heatmaps & Histograms(2010 & 2016), Ivette created in Tableau Line graphs for Cost Per Meal(2013-2015, 2016-2018, 2009-2019), Nicole created charts combining stats2010 & 2016-2020)<br />
